Will is wearing planet socks today. Last Friday this reporter confirmed that 
they are Saturn socks. We'll be calling them Saturn socks from now on. We saw
these socks [last Friday](/saturn-3/). In a surprise move Will has them back 
on today. If anything I would have expected his self-professed favorite dino
socks to be the first one to break four wears. What must have happened is that 
he did laundry over the weekend and since they were the last socks on the top
of the basket they were the first ones in the drawer this morning.

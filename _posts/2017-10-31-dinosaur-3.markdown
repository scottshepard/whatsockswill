Will has on his dinosaur socks today! These socks were last seen
on [October 9th](http://whatsocksdoeswillhaveontoday.com/dinosaur-2/). This is
the first pair of socks to make it to the thrice-worn category. It's an exciting
day for dino socks, but I'm pretty disappointed that Will isn't wearing spookier
socks for Halloween.
